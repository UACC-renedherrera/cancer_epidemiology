# Cancer Epidemiology


## Description


This project intends to describe cancer epidemiology in Arizona.


## Start Here


The [USCS data tidy script](/scripts/USCS_data_tidy.R) will download data from the CDC.gov website and prepare it for further analysis.


## Data Sources


### ADHS IBIS PH


The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) Indicator Based Information System for Public Health (IBIS-PH) system allows the public to query cancer rates, mortality rates and population estimates for Arizona. These public health data sets are intended to support evidenced-based decision making in Arizona to plan and improve service delivery, evaluate health care systems, and inform policy decisions.
